# AI Business Model Validation Pattern

This pattern provides a comprehensive framework for validating AI-focused business models. It is specifically designed for AI and AI-enabled businesses, incorporating both traditional business analysis methodologies and AI-specific considerations.

## Purpose

The pattern helps analyze and validate AI business models by examining:
- AI-specific unit economics and cost structures (API costs, compute, etc.)
- Market validation and potential in AI spaces
- Technical and operational sustainability
- Financial viability with AI-centric metrics
- AI-specific risks and challenges
- Strategic recommendations for AI businesses

## Key Features

- Deep analysis of AI-specific cost factors:
  - Compute resources and scaling
  - API margins and usage patterns
  - Model training and maintenance costs
  - Storage and infrastructure requirements
- Comprehensive sustainability assessment
- Clear go/no-go recommendation
- Actionable strategic recommendations
- Structured output with AI-relevant metrics and benchmarks

## Usage

```bash
AI_business_model_validation "Describe your AI business model here, including:
- Core AI value proposition
- Target market and use cases
- AI technology stack and dependencies
- Revenue model and pricing strategy
- Cost structure (compute, API, infrastructure)
- Key metrics (if available)
- Current challenges
- Growth plans"
```

## Example Input

```bash
AI_business_model_validation "We're building an AI content optimization platform:
- Value prop: AI-powered content optimization for engagement
- AI Stack: GPT-4 for analysis, BERT for classification
- Target: Content marketing teams and freelance writers
- Revenue: $29/mo per user, with team plans
- Costs: OpenAI API ($0.02/article), fine-tuning ($5k/mo)
- Current metrics: 100 beta users, 1000 articles/month
- Challenge: High API costs affecting margins
- Plan: Scale to 10k users in 12 months"
```

## Output Format

The pattern provides a structured analysis including:
1. Executive Summary
2. AI Technology Stack Assessment
3. Market Analysis
4. Unit Economics Analysis
5. Technical Sustainability
6. Risk Assessment
7. Strategic Recommendations
8. Go/No-Go Recommendation

## Notes

- Specifically designed for AI-first businesses and AI-enabled products
- Incorporates learnings from successful and failed AI ventures
- Helps identify and address common pitfalls in AI business models
- Updated to reflect current AI market conditions and cost structures
- Special focus on AI-specific challenges like model drift, compute costs, and API dependencies
